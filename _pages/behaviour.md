Every now and then our humans exhibit trully puzzling behaviour. Pulling me back when I am trying to put my paws on that pesky squirrel. Shouting at me when I 
helped them to disect that slipper into parts. Bizzarre creatures indeed!

## How to

- Do not panic
- Encourage your human to speak in a gentle, firm voice
- Ignore them unless human communicates slowly, clearly pronouncing every word. For the love of squirrel, who has time to listen to all the gibberish that they utter in their excitement?
- You may need to make your human repeat same word (or "command" as they call it) multiple times, in various situations - otherwise they never learn how to use it.
