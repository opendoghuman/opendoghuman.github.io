I am Fluffy, an amateur human trainer, collecting ~~licks~~ links, tips and tricks on how to make your biped human a success, so you are not embarassed walking them out and showing off to your friends. 

My goal is to improve behavior of 10,000 dog humans, make them give more treats, spend more time giving tummy rubs and enrich them through play.
