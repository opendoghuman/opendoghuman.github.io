I am Loki, an amateur human trainer, collecting ~~licks~~ links, tips and tricks on how to make your biped human a success, so you are not embarassed walking him out and showing them off to your friends in the neighbourhood. 

Our goal is to improve behavior of 10,000 dog humans, make them give more treats to our dog friends, get them spend more time giving us tummy rubs and enrich their day by learning from us through play.

This is an open source website hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/opendoghuman/opendoghuman.github.io). Feel free to open a pull request, and my human will be glad to review and update this website.
