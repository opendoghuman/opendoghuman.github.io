![Dog Playing](/media/dog-human-play.jpg){: style="max-height:300px;" }


Me loves games! Pulling, running, jumping, catching. 


We need to show our humans how to play proper games! You want your human's mind and body excercised at all times, so they are more willing to give you treatos!

## How to

- Play with your human 2-3 times a day for 15 minutes or so when they are at home 
- Don't push it, humans cannot take too much distraction from their sedentary activities - it may jeopardize your tummy rubbing or treat times if human is upset.
- Show your human which one is your favourite treat. Be a smart doggo to shown excitement, tail wags, big eyes, jump up towards the treat. 
- Don't give up, your human maybe getting it faster than my human, or may seem hopeless. Give your human some time, best if they learn on their own without you nipping pants or barking.
- Humans have near zero ability to smell anything. We, dogs, have 40% of our brain dedicated to olfactory (smelling) function. Sometimes I doubt if humans have any.
