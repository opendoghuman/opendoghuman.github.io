![Dog Teaching Human](/media/dog-human-play.jpg){: style="max-height:300px;" }


We like games! Pulling, running, jumping, catching. 

Humans say they like games too, sort of. What is that strange smelling, flat piece of wood with some rocks on it they keep moving for hours? When I try to pull it down to floor to make it a proper game, for some reason they get really agitated! Rrrrr! Borrrrrring!

In short, we need to show our humans how to play proper games! You want your human's mind and body excercised at all times, so they are more willing to give you treats!

## General guidelines

- Play with your human 2-3 times a day for 15 minutes or so when they are at home 
- Don't push it, humans cannot take too much distraction from their sedentary activities - it may jeopardize your tummy rubbing or treat times if human is upset.
- Show your human wwhich one is your favourite treat. Humans generally respond well when we show some excitement, wag our tail, make big eyes, jump towards the treat. 
- Don't give up, different humans take different time to click and understand how to play the game. Give your human some time, best if they learn on their own without us nipping their pants or occassionally barking.
- Olfactory function has remarkably low development in your human's brain, unlike ours - where it takes almost 40% (translation: humans have near zero ability to tell how many dogs were near this pole)
