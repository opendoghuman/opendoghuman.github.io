- Get your human off the sofa
# Dog point of view


Alright, human, listen up! It's time for a crash course in our favorite game. First off, we're starting right here at home, where the treats flow like water and the leashes are short. Here's the scoop:

Step 1: Leash up the pupper and get ready to toss some treats. Chuck that tasty morsel just out of reach, watch me strain to get it (spoiler alert: I can't!). After a minute of me giving you those puppy eyes, let me have it.

Step 2: Repeat step 1, but this time, don't let me snatch the treat. Wait till I turn back to you, then make like a rabbit and bolt the other way. That's right, human, we're playing chase! Drop a few more treats as you go.

Repeat this dance 3-4 times per play session, and soon enough, you'll see the magic happen:

I'll figure out that coming back to you means more treats, which is a win-win for both of us.
Running away gets me movin' and groovin', away from whatever spooky thing caught my eye.
And when you plop that treat on the ground instead of holding it hostage, it helps me chill out, lowering my stress levels.
Got it? Great! Now let's hit the backyard and put this plan into action! üêæ

At home first:

Treat stands in for another trigger,  distraction,  another dog

step 1
- put dog on a short leash
- toss a treat further than the leash
- dog pulls,  can't get it
- wait a minute, then let dog get it

step 2
- do the same  but not let them get it
- wait until dog turns back and looks at you
- turn away, run 4-5 fear in opposite direction
- place down few more treats

repeat 3-4 times per session

- learn that coming back plays way better than being than one thing
- running the other way gets them into movement,  moves away from the trigger,  moving on their own
- putting did if the ground lowers arousal state,  instead of holding in hand (1:19:26
