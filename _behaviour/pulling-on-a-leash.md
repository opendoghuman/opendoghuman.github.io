Pulling human on a leash is not easy. Humans are usually slow, heavy and somewhat stubborn. Plus they rarely have any interest in sniffing that doggo in front of us, let alone a BUNNY RABBIT! THERE! LOOOK! I NEED TO BE THERE... uh, uth... it's gone. C'mon human!

Few ideas how to get the human calm down and take us places. 

# Stop and wait

Just like that. Human stops and waits. No pulling back, no jerking. 

Every smart doggo will eventually get tired hanging on that leash. My neck health is more important. 

Also why are we not moving? Lets check back and see what is that human doing - is she distracted and not paying full attention on me? 

Alright I'll give her a slack, step back a bit - less tension on the neck this way.


# Gentle leader

Some humans never learn. I mean there is so much going on out here, and I only have 0.5h to check out the news, catch that squirrel and leave my mark on that tree. 

Consider this a time management advice. To remind us what we should focus on - human needs to get walked. Tired human is a good human!
