Here is another plan how  get those humans off their ~~tails~~ bums and into action. (Still can't figure out what happened to the tails of those poor humans, them trying to communicate with those awkward floppy noodles instead of a crisp wag?). 


So there I was, bored outta my mind while the human was glued to their chair, eyes glued to the glowing box they call a TeeVee (don't even get me started on that Fishing channel...). Here's how to get them moving and getting them a proper brain workout!

- Step 1: Grab them a small cloth towel, the kind humans use to wipe away their drool (weird, right?).
- Step 2: Show them how to load it up with your favorite treats (the ones that make your tail wag the fastest) right in the middle.
- Step 3: Let'em roll it up like a burrito (but way tastier)
- Step 4: We'll need those ~~noodles~~ hends to knot at the end and hand it over to your human, er, I mean, let them hand it over to you. Not too tight at first, as we need to work their magic and figure out how to get those treats. Mix things up by adjusting the knot size, tightness, and treat amount to keep things interesting.

And remember moderation is key! Keep those treats in check, just like how we keep an eye on our squirrel-chasing impulses. Treats are yummy, but they shouldn't replace our main meals. Stay smart, stay fed, and let's show those humans who's boss!
