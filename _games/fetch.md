Me going crazy! Nothing to do, borring, ready to chew that slipper, if not that human getting upset...

Which one is my favourite toy? I looove flying ducks, so anything that quacks and looks like a duck is a duck! I also love my green ball. Actually I have two of them looking exactly the same, but I love the one I got when I was a puppy (humans have no idea how I tell them apart rrrrr). You (the doggo), will most likely enjoy catching anything that moves and bounces a bit. 


# How to play 

Can't image you have to teach your human how to play this, but here we go!

Ensure you are in the safe area, with enough space to run around and throw the toy. Open, grassy area is ideal, but backyard or long hallway will be sufficient as well, as long as thera are no windows. Just stay away from roads with moving cars.

1. As always make sure the human is off the sofa, in upright position, hand holding your toy.
2. Make some loving eyes, maybe move your head a bit to hint human they have to throw it in that direction.
(They probably will botch it from the first time, it's ok - encourage them to do it again)
3. Chase it! 

Here where it gets interesting. Depending on your mood, you can bring it back or hold it in your mouth and make them chase you. 

If the human makes it worth it, like ready to give you a treat - consider bringing it back. Trrreats, rrright?

Otherwise you can look at them until that mushy matter in their bowler makes them realise that you are playing with them (maybe move your head up, or paw at them - I know, humans are slowpokes). Make them work it, and give you treats to give back a toy. Or you may turn this into a nice chase game with occasional tug of war. Make sure to make some encouraging growl (or whatever noise you make in your language, just don't make it too scary).

For double the fun, if you like swimming - do the same in the water. It's good fun for you and humans like to get sploshed too!
